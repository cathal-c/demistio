# demistio

De-mystifying Istio. Yeah I suck at naming things!

Istio is a Kubernetes native implementation of Envoy servive mesh. In my opinion, you don't know Istio if you don't know Envoy!

This tool generates and inspects Envoy configs exactly as Istio would, from real Kubernetes and Istio inputs.
