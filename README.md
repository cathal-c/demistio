# demistio

De-mystifying Istio.

Istio is a Kubernetes native implementation of Envoy service mesh.

In my opinion, you don't know Istio if you don't know Envoy!

This tool aims to bridge the gap between Istio and Envoy; it generates and inspects Envoy configs exactly as Istio would, from real Kubernetes and Istio inputs.
